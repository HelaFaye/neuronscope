# Every feature: in the UI, on the command line, and for agents

After `./install.sh`, nothing needs a terminal: start **NeuronScope** from the
app menu (or `./neuronscope`, or `NeuronScope.bat` on Windows) and Studio opens
in your browser. Everything below is also scriptable, for people who prefer a
shell and for automation; and the third column is what an AI agent (Cline,
Claude Desktop) can do through NeuronScope's MCP server ([CONNECT.md](CONNECT.md)).

Jobs on the Jobs page are the same scripts as the command-line column, built
from typed forms: no free-form command line, values cannot smuggle in flags,
each run keeps its log, and the form's fields are tested against the script's
own options.

The terminal client (`scripts/ns.py`, `./neuronscope cli`) and the Godot
client (`./neuronscope godot`) reach a running Studio, here or on another
machine; [CLIENTS.md](CLIENTS.md) compares the three.

## Setting up

| feature | in the UI | command line | MCP tool |
|---|---|---|---|
| Start Studio and open it | app menu → NeuronScope | `./neuronscope`, `python scripts/launch.py` | — |
| Models folder, llama-server, cett-dump, unloading, routing thresholds, worker limits | **Setup** | `~/.neuronscope/config.json`, or Studio's flags | — |
| Build llama.cpp with cett-dump | **Setup → Build**, or Jobs → Setup | `scripts/build_llama_tools.sh --backend vulkan` | `start_job build_llama` |
| Health check (packages, GPUs, build, model, pipeline) | **Setup → Health check** | `python scripts/doctor.py` | `doctor` |
| Hardware for worker models (ROCm, Vulkan, CUDA, Metal, CPU) | **Setup → Hardware** | `~/.neuronscope/hardware.json`, `python scripts/accelerators.py` | `devices` |
| Restart Studio | **Setup → Restart Studio** | stop and start it | — |
| Where models, llama.cpp, pipeline data and Studio's state live; switch layouts by name | **Settings → Workspaces** | `python scripts/ns_workspace.py`, `--workspace` on Studio, the launcher and doctor.py | — |
| The model `auto` uses for a subject | **Settings → Models per subject** | `subject_models` in `config.json` | — |
| When chat tool calls are allowed, asked or denied (rules, kinds, argument regexes, limits) | **Settings → Tool approval**; *always…* on an approval card | `python scripts/tool_rules.py` | — |
| What each feature needs (packages, programs, llama.cpp backends, drivers, devices, memory), with fixes for this OS | **Setup → Requirements** | `python scripts/ns_requirements.py` | `requirements` |
| Install a missing Python package | **Setup → Requirements → Install**, or Jobs → Setup | `python scripts/ns_requirements.py install <pkg>` | `start_job install_package` |
| Environment snapshots and what changed | **Setup → Requirements → snapshots** | `ns_requirements.py snapshot`, `diff`, `freeze` | `start_job env_snapshot` |

Network exposure (binding beyond this computer, tokens, TLS, remote jobs) is
deliberately not on the Setup page: set it in `config.json` or with flags
([SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)).

| Remote tuning worker | Lab → Adaptive tuning | `python scripts/tuning_worker.py` on the worker | — |

The worker side of a remote transfer or tuning run is started on the other
machine, by design: it opens a port there.

## Links between sections

When something on one page needs a step on another, the page links to that
section and option rather than naming it. Error messages and fixes that say
"Setup → Build llama.cpp", "Settings → Workspaces" or "Jobs → Evaluate"
turn into links wherever they are shown, and a link can open a job already
filled in. Addresses you can use yourself:

| address | opens |
|---|---|
| `/setup#build`, `#hardware`, `#health`, `#requirements`, `#snapshots`, `#paths` | that part of Setup |
| `/settings#workspaces`, `#subjects`, `#tools` | that part of Settings |
| `/jobs#kind=testqa&endpoint=m=http://127.0.0.1:7870/v1@MODEL&out=runs/t.json` | a job form, filled in (any field by name) |
| `/#models`, `/#tools`, `/#docs`, `/#hub`, `/#chats` | a Studio tab |
| `/#model=MODEL&field=classifier` | a model's settings, at that field |

`doctor.py` prints the matching Studio address after the first problem it
finds.
